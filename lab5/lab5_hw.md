## Data
For this homework, we will use two different data sets. Please load `amniota` and `amphibio`.  

### `amniota` data
Myhrvold N, Baldridge E, Chan B, Sivam D, Freeman DL, Ernest SKM (2015). “An amniote life-history
database to perform comparative analyses with birds, mammals, and reptiles.” _Ecology_, *96*, 3109.
doi: 10.1890/15-0846.1 (URL: https://doi.org/10.1890/15-0846.1).

```r
amniota <- 
  readr::read_csv("data/amniota.csv")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   .default = col_double(),
##   class = col_character(),
##   order = col_character(),
##   family = col_character(),
##   genus = col_character(),
##   species = col_character(),
##   common_name = col_character()
## )
```

```
## See spec(...) for full column specifications.
```

### `amphibio` data
Oliveira BF, São-Pedro VA, Santos-Barrera G, Penone C, Costa GC (2017). “AmphiBIO, a global database
for amphibian ecological traits.” _Scientific Data_, *4*, 170123. doi: 10.1038/sdata.2017.123 (URL:
https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.123).

```r
amphibio <- 
  readr::read_csv("data/amphibio.csv")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   .default = col_double(),
##   id = col_character(),
##   Order = col_character(),
##   Family = col_character(),
##   Genus = col_character(),
##   Species = col_character(),
##   Seeds = col_logical(),
##   OBS = col_logical()
## )
```

```
## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

## Questions  
**1. First, do some exploratory analysis of both data sets. What is the structure, column names, and dimensions?**  


**2. How many total NAs are in each data set? Do these values make sense? Are NAs represented by any other values?**   


**3. Make any necessary replacements in the data such that all NAs appear as "NA".**   


**4. Use the package `naniar` to produce a summary, including percentages, of missing data in each column for both data sets.**  


**5. For the `amniota` data, calculate the number of NAs in the `egg_mass_g` column sorted by taxonomic class; i.e. how many NAs are present in the `egg_mass_g` column in birds, mammals, and reptiles? Does this results make sense biologically? How do these results affect your interpretation of NAs?**  


**6. Which taxonomic classes are represented in the data? Summarize this in a chart then make a barplot that shows the proportion of observations in each taxonomic class.**


**7. Let's explore the taxonomic composition of the data a bit more. How many genera are represented by taxonomic class? Present this as a data table and bar plot.**


**8. Lastly, how many species are represented in each taxonomic class? Present this as a data table and bar plot.**


**9. The `amphibio` data includes information on ecology. Each species is classified as fossorial, terrestrial, aquatic, or arboreal. How many species are in each of these categories? Make a bar plot to visualize these results. Which category is most/ least represented in the data?**


**10. For the amphibio data, we are interested to know if body size is correlated with litter size? Make a plot that shows this relationship. You should notice that there are outliers. Can you think of a way to identify the outliers for both body size and litter size? What happens when you then re-plot the data?**
